# Bose Frames Preview

This is a project to preview how you look in the Bose Frames Altos. In a window on the website, the webcam is used to get image data and openCV and dlib are used to recognize the landmark points on the users face. These points are used to overlay an image of the Bose Frames over the eyes while remaining proportional.
